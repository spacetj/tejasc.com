#### Google Cloud Next '25: Enterprise-grade security and scale for serverless workloads with Cloud Run

Google's Xiaowen Xin and Thomas Shafer walk through the newest capabilities that make Cloud Run enterprise-ready end to end—from GPU-backed inference, cloud storage volume mounts, and direct VPC egress to integrated Identity-Aware Proxy, multi-region deployments, threat detection, organization policies, and automatic base-image patching. Tejas Cherukara then shares how ANZ Plus adopted Cloud Run as its default runtime, covering the migration playbook, financial guardrails, and platform-engineering investments such as the X Framework internal developer platform that shrinks developer cognitive load, reduces operator toil, and improves resiliency, productivity, and cost optimisation across more than 1,600 services.
