As an aspiring Cyber Security Engineer with a proven background in Reliability Engineer, I focus on automating toil, improving observability, enforcing Error Budgets and architecting GCP services. I'm a strong believer in Open Source and Shift Left philosophies. When I'm not working, you'll find me snowboarding or riding my Benelli Leoncino motorcycle.
